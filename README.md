It's finally here! This Halloween, we're kicking off our first-ever Kiroween hackathon, our annual challenge designed to inspire wild, creative ideas that would be difficult to bring to life with traditional tooling. We are awarding $100,000 across 12 different prizes and 66 winners, with a 1st place prize of $30,000. Come experience how Kiro's agentic capabilities like specs, agent hooks, steering, and MCP can push the boundaries of what is possible. We can't wait to see how Kiro can empower you, whether you're a seasoned developer, a startup founder, a designer, or a tinkerer.

Note: We will be providing supplemental Kiro usage to participants equivalent to the Kiro Pro+ tier throughout the submission period. Once you register for Kiroween, you will receive a confirmation email with detailed instructions on how to receive the benefits. Our priority is making sure you have the resources to meaningfully build and experiment with Kiro.

Dare to code in dark mode
The challenge is to build a working app using Kiro, inspired by a set of spooky categories to get you in the Halloween spirit. We wanted to keep these open-ended so you can build what excites you the most, and inspiring enough to bring out some really cool and unique app ideas:

Resurrection: Bring your favorite dead technology back to life. Reimagine obsolete tech with today’s innovations or solving tomorrow's problems.

Frankenstein: Stitch together a chimera of technologies into one app. Bring together seemingly incompatible elements to build something unexpectedly powerful.

Skeleton Crew: Build a skeleton code template lean enough to be clear but flexible enough to support various use cases. Show us its versatility with two distinct applications from your foundation.

Costume Contest: Build any app but show us a haunting user interface that’s polished and unforgettable. Bring in spooky design elements that enhance your app’s function.

Plus, a startup flavor
We’ve added a new prize category for Kiroween that awards $10,000 to the Best Startup Project (see full rules for submission details). We want to provide startup founders a chance to rapidly prototype and develop concepts that would typically require significantly more resources. Kiro's ability to accelerate development cycles means you can test more ambitious ideas, with faster iterations, and emerge with a compelling product —all within the hackathon timeframe.

The deets
Key dates:

Launch: Friday, October 31, 2025, 9am PT

Submission Deadline: Friday, December 5, 2025, 2pm PT

Prize pool: A total of $100,000 in prizes awaits, including category winners, overall winners, and special bonus prizes for creativity, social engagement, and more.

Judging criteria: Your submission will be evaluated by a panel of expert industry judges, including Ania Kubow, Santiago Valdarrama, Rachel Stephens, and more. Each app will be assessed based on:

Potential Value: How useful, accessible, and impactful is your solution?

Implementation: How effectively did you leverage Kiro's capabilities?

Quality and Design: How creative, original, and polished is your project?

Submission Requirements: You'll need to provide your public code repository with the .kiro directory (showing how you used specs, hooks, and steering), a functional application URL, a 3-minute demonstration video, and documentation on how you utilized Kiro throughout your development process that shows us your next-level understanding of its features, such as:

Vibe coding: How did you structure your conversations with Kiro to build your project? What was the most impressive code generation Kiro helped you with?

Agent hooks: What specific workflows did you automate with Kiro hooks? How did these hooks improve your development process?

Spec-driven development: How did you structure your spec for Kiro to implement? How did the spec-driven approach improve your development process? How did this compare to vibe coding?

Steering docs: How did you leverage steering to improve Kiro’s responses? Was there a particular strategy that made the biggest difference?

MCP: How did extending Kiro’s capabilities help you build your project? What sort of features or workflow improvements did MCP enable that otherwise would have been difficult or impossible?

Discord is the place to be
The Kiro Discord awaits with a dedicated #kiroween-hackathon channel where you can connect with fellow participants, form teams, share ideas, and get support from other developers and Kiro team members. Our community is ready to help you navigate challenges, offer feedback, and celebrate your progress along the way. We also have bi-weekly office hours where you’ll be able to ask questions in real time to our product experts. Beyond the hackathon, you’ll find project spotlights, product announcements, event updates, and other news and resources regularly shared. See you there?

Ready to git commit to the darkness?
Kiroween was designed for Kiro developers as a fun opportunity to experiment with Kiro and leverage the full gamut of features and capabilities it offers. This is your moment to create something unforgettable. Get inspired by Kiroween’s special spooky factor, summon your ideas, and git commit to the darkness.

🎃 Welcome to Kiroween 👻
This Halloween, we’re kicking off our first-ever Kiroween hackathon. Experience how Kiro, our AI-powered IDE, can help you build out your spookiest, most creative, monstrous ideas. Whether you’re bringing dead tech back to life, stitching together something unexpected, or creating a UI that will give your users nightmares, Kiro will partner with you every step of the way. From brainstorming in natural conversation to building robust, spec-driven systems, Kiro handles the heavy lifting so you can focus on the magic.

For the love of building, or maybe the love of darkness, come craft something wicked and show us how you use Kiro’s features to push boundaries: vibe code in chat, add structure with specs, customize workflows with hooks or steering, or bring in new capabilities with MCP. Your creation will be judged on its potential value, implementation of Kiro, and creativity. 

This is your moment to create something unforgettable. Get inspired by Kiroween’s special spooky factor, summon your ideas, and git commit to the darkness.

Requirements
What to Build
Entrants must build a working software application that uses Kiro (vibe coding, agent hooks, steering docs, MCP, or specs) and submit it into one of the following categories:

Categories:
Resurrection: Bring your favorite dead technology back to life. Reimagine obsolete tech with today’s innovations or solving tomorrow's problems.

Frankenstein: Stitch together a chimera of technologies into one app. Bring together seemingly incompatible elements to build something unexpectedly powerful.

Skeleton Crew: Build a skeleton code template lean enough to be clear but flexible enough to support various use cases. Show us its versatility with two distinct applications from your foundation.

Costume Contest: Build any app but show us a haunting user interface that’s polished and unforgettable. Bring in spooky design elements that enhance your app’s function.

What to Submit
Provide a URL to your open source code repository for judging and testing. 

The code repository must be public with an approved OSI Open Source License

Your repo must contain the /.kiro directory at the root of the project to show usage of specs, hooks, and steering. Do NOT add the /.kiro directory or sub-folders to your .gitignore, as this could disqualify your submission.

For Skeleton Crew projects only: Your repo must contain 2 separate repo folders for the 2 separate applications.

Provide a URL to your functional application(s)

You can provide login credentials in public code repo

Include a three (3) minute demonstration video of your submission. Videos must be uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, or Facebook Video and made public and judges are not required to watch beyond 3 minutes.

Identify which category and bonus category you are submitting into.

Provide a write up on how Kiro was used. Judges must understand how effectively you used Kiro to develop your project. Show us your next-level understanding of Kiro features, e.g.:

Vibe coding: How did you structure your conversations with Kiro to build your project? What was the most impressive code generation Kiro helped you with?

Agent hooks: What specific workflows did you automate with Kiro hooks? How did these hooks improve your development process?

Spec-driven development: How did you structure your spec for Kiro to implement? How did the spec-driven approach improve your development process? How did this compare to vibe coding?
