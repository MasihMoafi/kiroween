# Product Overview

**Static: Layers of Fear** is a psychological horror CRT television experience built for the Kiroween 2025 Hackathon.

## Concept
A vintage 1970s CRT TV that users interact with. Three horror game modes accessible via menu. The horror comes from atmosphere and discomfort, not jump scares.

## Core Experience
- Click to enter → static boot → terminal boot sequence → main menu
- Three modes: Truth or Dare, Whispers, Kiroween
- Interactive candles that affect gameplay (candle dare)
- Equipment rack with working audio controls

## Design Philosophy
- **Visual**: Authentic CRT effects (scanlines, phosphor glow, vignette, flicker, chromatic aberration)
- **Color**: Phosphor green (#c0ffc0) on dark background, orange candle glow
- **Tone**: Unsettling, uncomfortable, sad - "the sadness IS the horror"
- **Audio**: Music box loops, ElevenLabs TTS with creepy voices, sound effects via Web Audio API

## Inspiration
- Layers of Fear (psychological horror game)
- Call of Duty: Black Ops terminal
- Vintage CRT televisions
